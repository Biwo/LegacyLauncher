--------------&lt;br>&lt;br>
&lt;b>Version 0.19:&lt;/b>&lt;br>
- Remove support for versions of Android beyond 4.0 since it broke at least the scrollable widgets functionality (force close loops), until it is tested. Also removed system persistence since it is now deprecated and was never recommended in the first place by AOSP.&lt;br>
&lt;b>Version 0.18:&lt;/b>&lt;br>
- Add workaround for issue causing pages in horizontal layout not to render when there are just too many of them&lt;br>
&lt;b>Version 0.17:&lt;/b>&lt;br>
- Fix FC with catalogs less than Android 2.3, other changes to catalogs, preliminary support for Android 3 and 4&lt;br>
