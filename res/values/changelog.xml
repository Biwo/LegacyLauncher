&lt;b>Version 0.20:&lt;/b>&lt;br>
- Fix for drawer open view restore&lt;br>&lt;br>
&lt;b>Version 0.19:&lt;/b>&lt;br>
- Remove support for versions of Android beyond 4.0 since it broke at least the scrollable widgets functionality (force close loops), until it is tested. Also removed system persistence since it is now deprecated and was never recommended in the first place by AOSP.&lt;br>&lt;br>
