LegacyLauncher
==============

Legacy Launcher for Android is a free open-source replacement home screen application. It is built on top of the last version of ADW Launcher Free (from the open-source Cyanogenmod 7 branch), and most of the functionality comes from there.

This launcher is similar to old ADW Launcher Free before its major update in October 2012. 


This launcher was branched from: 
https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_packages_apps_ADWLauncher

If using the Android SDK, building branches of AOSP Launcher such as LegacyLauncher requires that the source code be built with internal and hidden APIs. Instructions to do so can be found at here: http://devmaze.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/using-com-android-internal-part-1-introduction/

Builds of LegacyLauncher are currently built with API level 10 with internal and hidden APIs.
