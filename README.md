LegacyLauncher
==============

Legacy Launcher for Android is a free open-source replacement home screen application. It is built on top of the last version of ADW Launcher Free (from the open-source Cyanogenmod 7 branch, found at https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_packages_apps_ADWLauncher), and most of the functionality comes from there.

This launcher is similar to old ADW Launcher Free before its major update in October 2012. 

It is compatible with Android 2.1 to Android 2.3.7.



This launcher was branched from: 
https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_packages_apps_ADWLauncher

If using the Android SDK, building branches of AOSP Launcher such as LegacyLauncher requires that the source code be built with internal and hidden APIs. Instructions to do so can be found at here: http://devmaze.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/using-com-android-internal-part-1-introduction/

Builds of LegacyLauncher are currently built with API level 10 with internal and hidden APIs. 


New features include: 
* launcher lockdown (desktop icons and widgets, long-press actions, with simple password support
reorganized preferences, including the ability to see what your selections are within the preference screen for colors and numbers
* ability to disable multi-touch screen previews completely
* ability to tune application tray performance
* improved support for different sized screens (in-progress)
* customization of drawer, folder, and desktop font sizes
