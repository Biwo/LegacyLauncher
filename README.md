LegacyLauncher
==============

Legacy Launcher for Android is a free open-source replacement home screen application. It is built on top of the last version of ADW Launcher Free (from the open-source Cyanogenmod 7 branch), and most of the functionality comes from there.

This launcher is similar to old ADW Launcher Free before its major update in October 2012. 


This launcher was branched from:
